* World Bank Data in Julia

As part of the World Bank's Open Data initiative, the World Bank
provides free access to their extensive database through their [[http://data.worldbank.org/developers/data-catalog-api][Data
Catalog API]]. This Julia package makes use of the API to interactively
access and download World Bank data in Julia.

Similar to the [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WDI/index.html][WDI R package]], data can be downloaded using function
~wdi~. This function accepts indicators and countries as ~String~ or
~Array{String, 1}~. Thereby, countries must be given as World Bank's
*iso2c code*. Two additional ~Int~ inputs allow specifying beginning
and end of the data period, while input ~true~ for keyword argument
~extra~ attaches further country information like the capital,
longitude, latitude, income range, etc. to each observation. Output
will be of type ~TimeData~ by default, but can be set to ~DataFrame~
through keyword argument ~format~.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
   using WorldBankData
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl

   ## multiple indicators, single country
   data = WorldBankData.wdi(["NY.GNP.PCAP.CD", "SP.DYN.LE00.IN"],

* Indicator and country metadata

In addition to the indicator itself, the World Bank also provides a
lot of metadata for countries and indicators which can be downloaded
with function ~getWBMeta~.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
   countryData = getWBMeta("countries")
   countryData[1:5, :]
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| iso3c | iso2c | name        | region                                        | regionId | capital    | longitude | latitude | income               | incomeId | lending        | lendingId |

Country metadata provides information for each country or aggregated
entity with respect to the following characteristics:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
names(countryData)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| iso3c     |
| iso2c     |
| name      |
| region    |
| regionId  |
| capital   |
| longitude |
| latitude  |
| income    |
| incomeId  |
| lending   |
| lendingId |

Overall, the country metadata is a ~DataFrame~ of the following size: 

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
size(countryData)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| 262 |
|  12 |

Quite similarly, you can access the complete indicator metadata
through input ~indicators~.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
indicatorData = getWBMeta("indicators")
indicatorData[1:5, :]
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| indicator            | name                                     | description                                                                                                                | source_database | source_databaseId | source_organization                                                   |

| 1.0.HCount.Mid10to50 | Middle Class ($10-50 a day) Headcount    | The poverty headcount index measures the proportion of the population with daily per capita income below the poverty line. | LAC Equity Lab  |                37 | LAC Equity Lab tabulations of SEDLAC (CEDLAS and the World Bank).     |
| 1.0.HCount.Ofcl      | Official Moderate Poverty Rate-National  | The poverty headcount index measures the proportion of the population with daily per capita income below the poverty line. | LAC Equity Lab  |                37 | LAC Equity Lab tabulations of data from National Statistical Offices. |

The metadata contains information about each indicator regarding the
following characteristics:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
names(indicatorData)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| indicator           |
| name                |
| description         |
| source_database     |
| source_databaseId   |
| source_organization |

Just take a look at the size of this table in order to get an
impression about the huge amount of indicators that are provided by
the World Bank.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
size(indicatorData)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| 13074 |
|     6 |

You can use these two ~DataFrames~ of country and indicator metadata
to easily search for information through function ~search_wdi~. Before
looking at that, however, let's first spend a few words on downloading
and caching of country and indicator metadata.

Function ~getWBMeta~ is required to force a fresh download of
metadata. In general, however, you do not need to download metadata
each time that you want to conduct a search. Hence, you should rather
use function ~loadWBMeta~ instead, which only downloads metadata in
case that it can neither be accessed from disk nor from the workspace
of the current Julia session. ~getWBMeta~ should be called only if you
think that your local metadata was corrupted in some way and needs to
be refreshed.

Calling ~loadWBMeta~ will first try to access metadata stored in
global variables ~WorldBankData.country_cache~ and
~WorldBankData.indicator_cache~ of the current session. If these
variables have not been assigned yet, it looks for a local version of
the data in directory *WorldBankData/data*. If there is no local
version yet, it will automatically call ~getWBMeta~, which will
download the data and store it both on local disk and as caching
variables in the current session.

Hence, as we already did load the data, we can access the cached
versions in our current workspace.

* Searching

The most convenient way to explore indicators probably still is the
[[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator][World Bank webpage]], where you can easily use the search functionality
to find what your are looking for. Once you found the indicator of
interest, you can read off the indicator shortcut name (e.g.
SP.DYN.LE00.IN) from the URL of the indicator webpage.

Alternatively, however, this package also contains functionality to
interactively search the database from Julia itself. Thereby, function
~search_wdi~ makes use of cached country and indicator metadata to
speed up search operations. As first argument, you need to choose the
metadata to be searched. This can be either "countries" or
"indicators". The second argument needs to specify the column to be
searched, while the actual search term needs to be given as regex as
third argument.

For example, searching the ~:name~ column of countries for a case
insensitive occurrence of "united":

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
   res = search_wdi("countries", :name, r"united"i)
   res
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Or, searching indicators by some given description:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
res = search_wdi("indicators", :description, r"gross national expenditure"i)
res[:name]
#+END_SRC

* Tips and Tricks

You can subset your data with respect to rows, columns or individual
entries through the ordinary ~TimeData~ functions. For example,
selecting entries of US only:
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
   data = wdi("NY.GNP.PCAP.CD", ["US","BR"], 1980, 2012, extra = true)
   usData = chkDates(x-> x[:iso2c] .== "US", eachdate(data)) |>
            x -> asArr(x, Bool, false) |>
            x -> data[x[:], :]
   usData

Furthermore, data can be visualized through the ~TimeData~ plotting
functions. Simply call function ~loadPlotting~ to load ~Winston~ and
~Gadfly~ packages, and directly plot the data as ~Timenum~ object
through ~wstPlot~ or ~gdfPlot~:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle no
      data = wdi("AG.LND.ARBL.HA.PC", "US", 1900, 2011)
      arableLand = convert(Timematr, data[symbol("AG.LND.ARBL.HA.PC")])

      loadPlotting()
      
      ## using Winston
      wstPlot(arableLand)
      
      ## using Gadfly
      gdfPlot(arableLand)
#+END_SRC

In case of missing values, ~wdi~ will return an empty TimeData object
without warning.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :results value :tangle test/doctests.jl
   dfAS = wdi("EN.ATM.CO2E.KT", "AS")

* Acknowledgement

Most of the package originally has been developed by [[https://github.com/4gh][4gh]] (Frank
Herrmann) and can still be accessed in its earliest version as a
[[https://github.com/4gh/WorldBankData.jl][github repository]]. As already some time did pass since his last
development, the code required some minor updates in order to reflect
the more recent changes of ~DataFrames~. The overall functionality of
the original code was so nice that I decided it was worthwhile to
spend some additional effort to publish and maintain an updated
version as official package to make it available to as many people as
possible.
