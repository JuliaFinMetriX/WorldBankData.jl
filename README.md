**Acknowledgements** 

Most of the package originally has been developed by
[4gh](https://github.com/4gh) (Frank Herrmann) and can still be
accessed in its earliest version as a [github
repository](https://github.com/4gh/WorldBankData.jl). As already some
time did pass since his last development, the code required some minor
updates in order to reflect the more recent changes of `DataFrames`.
The overall functionality of the original code was so nice that I
decided it was worthwhile to spend some additional effort to publish
and maintain an updated version as official package to make it
available to as many people as possible.
